### Utilities

All the exposed utilities are available as stand alone CLI tools. This is just a convinient wrapper that uses those tools to expedite development of **core.io** applications.

#### Shuttle

With shuttle you can create local environments for development on macOS computers. 

It uses [Caddy][caddy] and [Dnsmasq][dnsmasq] to provide a reverse proxy for your local webservers. You can also create a local tunnel which you can share to access your local server remotely- it uses [ngrok][ngrok] under the hood.

You need to have [Homebrew][brew] installed, as it uses brew to install some dependencies.

#### Generator

Create new projects of any type using templates. A template is usually stored as a github repository and provides everything you need to create a new project and get started quickly.

Check out the **core.io** [starter template][starter-template] or a [node template][node-template], you can get an idea of how to create your own templates.

#### Schema

If you application uses [persistence][core.io-persistence] and has models that expose an `schema` property, then you can use this utility to generate a `schema.json` file that can be used as input for scaffolding CRUD views.

#### Scaffold

Using this command and a valid gui-schema file, generated by the `schema` command you can generate CRUD views.

### REPL

**core.io** applications can expose a REPL that can be accessed with this command.
